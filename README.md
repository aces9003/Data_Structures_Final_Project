# Data_Structures_Final_Project
Data Structures Final Project Spring 2015 Semester

This group project involved 3 different tasks relating to Graph theory.
We implemeneted a Graph under the GenCode directory that we recycled for each task.

Task 1 involved implementing Kruskal's Algorithm to find a Minimum Spanning Tree.

Task 2 involved implementing a Topological Sort to sort input.

Task 3 involved implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm as single-source shortest paths.
